/*
numpy.convolve(a, v, mode='full')
Reverse the order of elements in an array along the given axis.
The shape of the array is preserved, but the elements are reordered.

Parameters
    a : Input array. First one-dimensional input array.
    v : Second one-dimensional input array.
    mode : {‘full’, ‘valid’, ‘same’}, optional
    ‘full’: By default, mode is ‘full’. This returns the convolution at each point of overlap,
        with an output shape of (N+M-1,). At the end-points of the convolution, the signals do not
        overlap completely, and boundary effects may be seen.
    ‘same’: Mode ‘same’ returns output of length max(M, N). Boundary effects are still visible.
    ‘valid’: Mode ‘valid’ returns output of length max(M, N) - min(M, N) + 1. The convolution product is only
        given for points where the signals overlap completely. Values outside the signal boundary have no effect.
Returns
    outarray_like: A view of m with the entries of axis reversed. 
                Since a view is returned, this operation is done in constant time.
